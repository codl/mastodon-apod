        Questions (FAQ) </h1></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<hr>\n<p>\n\nQ1: What
        does APOD stand for? <br> \nA1: APOD stands for the <a href=\n\"https://apod.nasa.gov/\"\n>Astronomy
        Picture of the Day</a>.  We abbreviate this \nas APOD instead of ApotD because
        APOD sounds better \n(spoken: AYE-pod).  <p>\n\nQ2: How can I easily see yesterday's
        APOD? <br>\nA2: Click the &lt; less than sign &lt; at the left of\ntoday's
        APOD link line (near the bottom of the daily page). <p>\n\nQ3: How can I see
        an APOD that ran long ago? <br>\nA3: All APODs are archived.  To see any past
        APOD, access the archive\npage.  This is found by clicking \"archive\" on
        the link line, or even by\nclicking \"Discover the Cosmos\" near the top of
        recent APOD pages. <p>\n\nQ4: Have some APOD pictures been run more than once?
        \ <br>\nA4: Yes. Many of our readers have been with us less than a year and
        are\nunaware of some really spectacular or important astronomy pictures. New\ninformation
        about old pictures is becoming available over the WWW. The\ntext and links
        for rerun pictures will make use of this newly\navailable information. So
        although the picture might be old, some of\nthe text and links of each APOD
        will be new.  Also, more web surfers\nhave larger bandwidth connections, which
        allows us to post\nhigher-resolution image files that can be transferred conveniently.\nSoftware
        to handle more sophisticated image file formats has also\nbecome more common,
        so the picture's size\nand/or format might be new. Lastly, rerunning APODs
        saves us time and\nhelps us update our archive. In general, our rerun policy
        currently is\nto only rerun APODs more than one year old to keep the pictures\nrelatively
        \"new\" to new APOD viewers. We will almost\nnever rerun more than two pictures
        in any given week.\nSo when you load the current\nAPOD,it is still, most probably,
        a new picture. <p>\n\nQ5: I have a picture that would make a good APOD. Will
        you use it? <br>\nA5: We can't promise to use it but we do strongly encourage
        picture\n<a href=\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/apsubmit2015.html\"\n>submissions
        to APOD</a>.  Even if you only know of a good picture, please\ntell us about
        it.  If you own the copyright for a submitted picture,\nplease grant us explicit
        permission to use it.  The best way to show us\nyour picture is to load it
        onto a web page and send us the URL. <p>\n\nPlease note that by submitting
        your image to APOD, you are consenting for your image to be used on APOD in
        all of its forms, including mirror sites, foreign language mirror sites, and
        direct APOD derivative products. Some of these, like Facebook, carry advertising.
        We do recommend that you include a small copyright notice in a corner of your
        submitted images. <p>\n\nQ6: Can I use an APOD picture for my computer-screen
        background? <br>\nA6: For personal, non-commercial, non-public fair use, yes.
        <p>\n\nQ7: How can I get a nice poster of a particular APOD? <br>\nA7: APOD
        does not sell posters. We therefore suggest that you print out a copy for
        personal use, or use a search engine to locate a version for sale by a vendor.
        \n\n<p>\n\nQ7a: How can I see a higher-resolution version of a particular\nAPOD?</br>\nA7a:
        Clicking on the picture itself brings up the highest\nresolution version of
        the image available from APOD.  It is possible\nthat higher resolution versions
        exist.  To find these you should\nfollow the informative links in the APOD
        text.<p>\n\nQ8: Can I use APOD pictures in my classroom? <br>\nA8: For non-commercial
        fair use, yes.  Please note that many APOD\nimages have are copyrighted and
        so to use them commercially you must\ngain explicit permission from the copyright
        owners.  Many times, these\ncopyright owners can be found by following the
        links provided under the\nAPOD image(s).  <p>\n\nQ9: Can I use your APOD images
        for my brochure? <br>\nA9: Many APOD images are copyrighted and so to use
        them you must write\nto the copyright owners for explicit permission. Many
        times, these\ncopyright owners can be found by following the links provided
        under the\nAPOD image(s).  <p>\n\nQ10: Can you please answer this question
        about astronomy? <br>\nA10: We do get a lot of e-mail and can't promise to
        respond due to time\nconstraints.  However, the APOD bulletin board \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/\">Starship
        Asterisk</a> \nis filled with knowledgeable and enthusiastic people who would
        actually \nenjoy answering all of your astronomy questions.  In particlar,
        \nStarship Asterisk's \n<a href=\"http://asterisk.apod.com/viewforum.php?f=30\"\n>Library</a>
        is designed for newcomers.  \nPlease ask -- there is no question too easy
        or too hard.  \n\nAlternatively, there are other web sites that are\ndevoted
        to providing answers to space and astronomy questions.  \nTwo of these that
        keep an impressive archive of questions and answers are: \n<a href=\"http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/askmag.html\">Ask
        the Space\nScientist</a> and \n<a href=\"http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/\nask_an_astronomer.html\">Ask
        an Astrophysicist</a>.\nPlease note that if you ask your question and it is
        answered\npublicly, others can gain from your curiosity.  <p>\n\nQ11: Is APOD
        available as a book? <br>\nA11: Selections from APOD's daily pages have been
        compiled into\ntwo books titled \"Universe: 365 Days\" (May 1, 2003) and \"Astronomy:\n365
        Days\" (October 1, 2006) - Publisher: Harry N Abrams.\n<p>\n\nQ12: Is APOD
        available as a CD? <br>\nA12: Sorry, APOD CDs are no longer available.\n<p>\n\nQ13:
        What if I used to be a millionaire but then I believed something\nI read on
        APOD and now own only a single dented bucket?<br>\nA13: There are no guarantees.
        Use APOD information at your own risk.<p>\n\nQ14: How long will APOD keep
        going? <br>\nA14: If the \"Tomorrow\" line at the bottom of today's APOD is
        not blank,\nthen at least until tomorrow. (Probably.) We certainly have no
        plans\nto stop soon.  If you check the apod archive you can see that it begins\nin
        June 1995.\n<p>\n\nQ15: Won't APOD soon run out of pictures? <br>\nA15: Probably
        not. NASA has archived literally hundreds of thousands of\nspace and astronomy
        related pictures and APOD readers have come to\nsubmit many images for our
        consideration.\nSo far, we have more good pictures than we can run.\n<p>\n\nQ16:
        Who writes the APOD text? <br>\nA16: Robert J. Nemiroff and Jerry T. Bonnell
        have written most\nevery APOD. Starting in 2020, APOD has occasionally\nrun
        text written by volunteers. \nIn general, volunteers are professional astronomers.
        APOD occasionally \nreuses APOD text, in part to avoid restating a point that
        \nhas been well-stated on APOD before. <p>\n\n\nBob and Jerry are friends,
        professional astronomers, and\nwere once office-mates at NASA's Goddard Space
        Flight Center in\nGreenbelt, MD.  Presently, Bob is a professor at Michigan\nTechnological
        University in Houghton, Michigan, USA, while Jerry is a\nscientist at NASA/Goddard.
        They are two mild and lazy guys\nwho might otherwise appear normal to an unsuspecting
        guest. Together,\nthey have found new and unusual ways of annoying people
        such as\nstaging <a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/debate/debate.html\"\n>astronomical
        debates</a>. Most people are surprised to learn that they\nhave developed
        the perfect\n<a href=\"http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_dig.html\">random\nnumber
        generator</a>. <p>\n\nQ17: If you guys weren't so modest, what would you tell
        us about APOD? <br>\nA17: Since we are so modest we keep quiet about a lot
        of things.  For\nexample, it just wouldn't be proper to let slip that we feel
        that APOD\nis one of the first sites (since 1995) to make journalistic use
        of full\nweb hypertext. By \"full web hypertext\", we mean that the APOD text
        is\nliberally annotated with hyperlinks to anywhere on the web where good\nand
        relevant information is available.  We don't claim to be good at\nwriting
        full web hypertext (we're too modest), just relatively early\nusers of this
        informative type of writing.\n<p>\n\nRobert J. Nemiroff and Jerry T. Bonnell
