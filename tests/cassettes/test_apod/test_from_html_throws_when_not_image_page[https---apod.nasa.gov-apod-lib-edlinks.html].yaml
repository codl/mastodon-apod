        of resources that excel in astronomy\neducation. Each resource is distinctly
        different - they have been chosen to\nhighlight a wide range of interests.
        We believe the list is topologically\ncomplete in that there are no publicly
        advertised \nastronomy resources on the WWW that cannot be\nfound by following
        the internal links of these resources.  The list is in\nalphabetical order,
        and is subject to change as the WWW, and our knowledge\nof it, matures.  \n\n<p>
